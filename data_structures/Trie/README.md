## Trie

A Trie is a tree-based data structure used to efficiently store and
retrieve strings, especially useful for prefix-based searches.

### Common Use Cases
- Autocomplete systems
- Spell checkers
- Dictionary implementations
- Prefix search

### Time Complexity

| Operation | Complexity |
|----------|------------|
| Insert   | O(n)       |
| Search  | O(n)       |
| Delete  | O(n)       |

*n = length of the word*

### Space Complexity
O(n)
