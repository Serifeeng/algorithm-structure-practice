## Stack

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle.

### Common Use Cases
- Function call management (call stack)
- Undo / redo operations
- Expression evaluation
- Backtracking algorithms

### Time Complexity

| Operation | Complexity |
|----------|------------|
| Access   | O(n)       |
| Search   | O(n)       |
| Push    | O(1)       |
| Pop     | O(1)       |

### Space Complexity
O(n)
