## Segment Tree

A Segment Tree is a tree-based data structure used for storing intervals
and efficiently answering range queries.

### Common Use Cases
- Range sum / min / max queries
- Competitive programming problems
- Querying subarrays efficiently
- Interval-based computations

### Time Complexity

| Operation      | Complexity |
|---------------|------------|
| Build Tree    | O(n)       |
| Range Query   | O(log n)   |
| Update        | O(log n)   |

### Space Complexity
O(n)
